  "children": {
    "previously": "changes/20200216.proposal.suite.json",
    "gathering": "A dynamic variable should serve as the container for all tests in the suite. This can be bound to a suite object that all tests append themselves to.",
    "resolution": "Tests should not run until a run method is called on the root suite object. This run should come with a query that matches tests.",
    "files": "Display should be by file. If there are multiple files matched, a successful run should not display detail. In the case of a failure or a single file, detail should be displayed.",
    "reloading": "Tests should have a record of the path of both their file and the file containing their target. This might require a more complex model of the system."
