Testing should be simple and freeform with the ability to configure functions before they are run.

```
(defun times (x y) (* x y))

(defun times-two (i) (times i 2))

(test times-two
  "Tests times-two"

  (it "Multiplies the argument by 2"
    (expect times-two :called-with 2 :to-equal 4))

  (it "Does not multiply the argument by 6"
    (expect times-two :called-with 2 :not :to-equal 12))

  (it "Expects `times` to be called"
    (spy-on times)
    (expect times :not :to-have-been-called)
    (times-two 3)
    (expect times :to-have-been-called-times 1)
    (expect times :to-have-been-called-with (3 2))))
```
